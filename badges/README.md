The files here are PDFs for 38mm badges. I got mine from
Awesome Merchandise who have since ceased trading, and been bought out by
[Print.inc](https://www.print.inc/p/611/38mm-round-badges)

These were handed out at FOSDEM 2019, and were a great success.

The files here are:

tribblix.pdf - the plain Tribblix logo

illumos-phoenix.pdf - the illumos phoenix, on a white background

tribblix+phoenix.pdf - the Tribblix logo and the illumos phoenix

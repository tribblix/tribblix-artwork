The files here are PDFs for 38mm badges. I got mine from
[Awesome Merchandise](http://www.awesomemerchandise.com/38mm-Badges)

These were handed out at FOSDEM 2019, and were a great success.

The files here are:

tribblix.pdf - the plain Tribblix logo

illumos-phoenix.pdf - the illumos phoenix, on a white background

tribblix+phoenix.pdf - the Tribblix logo and the illumos phoenix
